# three-js-ball

hello there, thanks for dropping by. this is a simple vue app i've been playing around with to explore three.js. it's a project from a course over at Harbour.Space University, guided by the digital puppetmaster Robert Borghesi ([@dghez](https://twitter.com/dghez_) on twitter).

## ðŸš€ features

- vue 3 implementation using typescript and the composition api
- three.js for 3d rendering
- interactivity via raytracing
- dynamic animations using gsap and lenis
- interactive gui for debugging and visualization adjustments with lil-gui
- performance monitoring with stats.js

## before we start

you'll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/). i'm using version `v20.1.0` for this project, paired with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) as the package manager.

## getting things ready

1. first off, grab the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

2. then to spin things up locally, run:

```bash
yarn dev
```

I'd love to see any tweaks or improvements you might have. enjoy tinkering! âœ¨
